            <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
            <p>The University of Venda library previously relied on manual paper-based registers for tracking book borrowing and returns. This traditional system created several significant challenges:</p>
            
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                <li><strong>Inaccurate Record Keeping:</strong> Manual entries led to errors in tracking which books were borrowed and when they were due.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Visibility:</strong> Students had no way to check their borrowed books or due dates without visiting the library.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost Records:</strong> Paper registers could be misplaced, damaged, or lost, resulting in permanent data loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Staff Workload:</strong> Library staff spent excessive time on manual data entry and record maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>No Overdue Tracking:</strong> Identifying overdue books required manual checking of all records.</li>
                <li><strong>Inefficient Searches:</strong> Finding specific books or borrower information was time-consuming.</li>
            </ul>
