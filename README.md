# University of Venda Library Management System

## Project Overview

The University of Venda Library Management System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to modernize and streamline library operations. This system replaces the traditional manual paper-based register system with a digital platform that provides efficient book tracking, user management, and administrative oversight.

## Problem Statement

The University of Venda library previously relied on manual paper-based registers for tracking book borrowing and returns, which created several significant challenges:

- **Inaccurate Record Keeping**: Manual entries led to errors in tracking borrowed books and due dates
- **Limited Visibility**: Students had no way to check their borrowed books or due dates remotely
- **Lost Records**: Paper registers could be misplaced, damaged, or lost permanently
- **Increased Staff Workload**: Library staff spent excessive time on manual data entry and maintenance
- **No Overdue Tracking**: Identifying overdue books required manual checking of all records
